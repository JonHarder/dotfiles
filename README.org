* Dotfiles

This repository holds all the dotfiles for applications I've configured.
It is structured to play nicely with gnu stow.

To make use of these dotfiles, clone the repo, cd into it, then
execute stow for each application you're interested in.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/JonHarder/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  stow emacs alacritty git # and any other app you want...
#+end_src
